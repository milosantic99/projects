          In machine learning, classification is a supervised learning concept which basically categorizes a set of data into classes. 
          For example, whether a person is suffering from a disease X (answer in Yes or No) can be termed as a classification problem.

          In machine learning, we use various kinds of algorithms to allow machines to learn the relationships within the data provided and make predictions using them. So, the kind of model prediction where we need the predicted output is a continuous numerical value, it is called a regression problem.
          Some famous Examples of regression problems are:<br>

             Predicting the house price based on the size of the house, availability of schools in the area, and other essential factors.<br>
             Predicting the sales revenue of a company based on data such as the previous sales of the company.
