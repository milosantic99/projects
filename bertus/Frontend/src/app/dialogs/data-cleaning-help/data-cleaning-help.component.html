        Scaling of the data makes it easy for a model to learn and understand the problem. Scaling of the data comes under the set of steps of data pre-processing when we are performing machine learning algorithms in the data set.
        This means that you're transforming your data so that it fits within a specific scale, like 0-100 or 0-1.
        In scaling, you're changing the range of your data, while.

        In normalization, you're changing the shape of the distribution of your data.
        Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.
