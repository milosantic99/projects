## Introduction

This is an open source project created to solve the problem that all travelers face when they want to visit an exotic location - what is there to be visited, and how it really looks without picture editing. If you've ever planned your next traveling adventure for the summer, you've certainly faced it too. The Internet is a wide place, and searching for reliable information on certain locations can be a long and exhausting process of digging through blogs, vlogs, maps and reddit groups. We strive to solve this problem by collecting all of that content in one place.

Our vision is to create a social media app that is completely oriented towards making accessing famous locations easier and chatting real time with people in any place on the globe. Every location will have its feed that users can browse and contribute to, alongside with the public chat where users can share their experiences or ask on the spot for valuable info that people currently physically present on that location can provide. 

This app is both tourist and enthusiast friendly, because _visiting_ interesting places has never been easier. Our goal is to create a platform that unites useful and fun, and that can spark our generation's interest in exploration and building friendships all across the globe.

## Technologies

These are the versions of technologies used:
* [Springboot framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), Java 17
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 15.0

To install the technologies you can download [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) or download Java language support extensions and Springboot extension pack in Visual Studio Code. PostgreSQL needs to be downloaded manually from their [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

_Noting that this particular repository contains only the **server side** of the application, that's created using Java Springboot and PostgreSQL. To run this project in its full functionality, you need to clone both **front-end** and **back-end** repository on your local machine._
